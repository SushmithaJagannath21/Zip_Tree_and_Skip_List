# Zip Tree and Skip List

The **Zip Tree and Skip List** project provides implementations of two advanced data structures: the **Zip Tree** and the **Skip List**. These data structures offer efficient solutions for maintaining ordered sets with operations such as insertion, deletion, and search. Both data structures provide probabilistic balancing, ensuring good performance in average cases.

## Features
- **Zip Tree Implementation**: A fast and simple alternative to AVL and Red-Black Trees with easy-to-understand balancing logic.
- **Skip List Implementation**: A probabilistic data structure that provides logarithmic search, insertion, and deletion operations.
- **Python-Based**: Implemented in Python with clear and well-documented code, making it easy to understand and modify.
- **Efficient Performance**: Both data structures offer expected O(log n) performance for insertion, deletion, and search operations.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The project is entirely written in Python for simplicity and portability.
